This is a project on using html to create a recipe book. i will be using some html functions in creating the recipes
functions like, ordered list,unordered list etc.
i hope im able to achieve my goal at the end of the project
stay tuned and enjoy a slice of my yummy cake recipes i will be creating

# project is going on well, i guess im on track to becoming a guru in html
# at first, i wasnt getting how to clone my project to github but i guess i have gotten it now
# this coding of a thing only require patience and due diligence to get a working code
